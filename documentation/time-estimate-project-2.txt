Estimate: 35 Hours

Looking at the coding workload based on how long it takes to write a single Line of Code we can estimate
that it will take 35 hours to do the work. The AI component will take ~500 lines of code to complete and 
the sound and animations will take ~100 lines of code. If each line of code takes ~3 minutes (.05 hours) 
than that adds up to 30 hours (600 * .05 = 30). Adding onto this the time it will take to have team meetings, 
an estimated 1 hour per team member, we are left with an estimate of 35 hours to complete Project 2.
