We believe that Team 5 used the Top-Down Functional Decomposition design paradigm when desgining
their Project 1.

The goal of Top-Down Functional Decomposition is to seperate the taskload into different components that
each have a critical aspect of functionality. For Project 1 it is easy to break down the project into four
aspects: Starting the Game, Setting up the Game, Playing the Game, Ending the Game.

It's easy to see that Team 5 thought of the project this way because they made four seperate views of the
game board each with the functionality lined out above. There is one view that allows the player to start 
the game and choose how many ships they are playing with, there is another view that lets the player set up
their game board, another view that facilitates the actual playing of Battleship, and finally a view that
shows who won.

In the ship placement view the screen into two different sections, the left side is a list of all the ships
(called a fleet by the program) and the right side of the screen is dedicated to a map which allows the
user to place those ships onto the board. The view where the game is played is also bisected; the left
side shows the user where there ships are and if they've been hit, and the right side shows the 
opponents ships and where the user has guessed.

Since the program was obviously designed with breaking up the code into sections that each tackle different
primary functions of Battleship we can easily say that the design paradigm they used was 
Top-Down Functional Decomposition.
